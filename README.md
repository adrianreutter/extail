# Extail
A project template that uses express and tailwindcss to make fast prototyping (without much css knowledge) possible.

## Start
Run ``yarn start`` to start the dev server.

## Routes
It is possible to create different routes by creating new folders with a .html file. 

**Examples**
|File|Route|
|---|---|
|routes/index.html|localhost:3000/|
|routes/test.html|localhost:3000/test|
|routes/test/index.html|localhost:3000/test/|
|routes/test/site.html|localhost:3000/test/site
