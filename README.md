# Extail
A project template that uses express and tailwindcss to make fast prototyping (without much css knowledge) possible.

## Start
Run ``yarn start`` to start the dev server.

## Routes
It is possible to create different routes by creating new folders with a index.html file. For example if you are visiting ``/`` you receive the /routes/index.html. If you are visiting ``/test/`` or ``/test`` ``/routes/test/index.html`` will be served.
